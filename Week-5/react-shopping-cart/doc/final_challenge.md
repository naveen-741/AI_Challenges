# Final Challenge: 7-Day Debugging Roadmap for `react-shopping-cart`

## Bug Categories & Priority Assessment

### 1. React Anti-Patterns & State Management Issues

- **Potential Issues:**
  - Direct state mutation
  - Non-functional state updates
  - Excessive prop drilling or context misuse
  - Unnecessary re-renders
- **Priority:** Critical if breaking state updates; otherwise, high for maintainability

### 2. Performance Bottlenecks & Optimization Opportunities

- **Potential Issues:**
  - Inefficient filtering or mapping over large arrays
  - Unmemoized expensive computations or callbacks
  - Unnecessary re-renders due to context or prop changes
- **Priority:** High-impact if causing UI lag or slow data loads

### 3. Error Handling Gaps & Edge Cases

- **Potential Issues:**
  - Missing try-catch around async API calls
  - No user feedback for errors
  - Unhandled promise rejections
  - No retry or fallback for network failures
- **Priority:** Critical if causing app crashes or silent failures

### 4. Security Vulnerabilities

- **Potential Issues:**
  - Exposing sensitive data in errors or logs
  - Insecure API calls (non-HTTPS)
  - Outdated dependencies with known vulnerabilities
- **Priority:** Critical for any direct vulnerabilities; high for potential risks

### 5. Code Quality & Maintainability Issues

- **Potential Issues:**
  - Unused code, imports, or variables
  - Poorly named functions or unclear logic
  - Lack of comments or documentation
  - Inconsistent formatting or lint errors
- **Priority:** Medium, but can become high if it impedes debugging or onboarding

## Debugging Roadmap (7 Days)

### **Day 1: Codebase Audit & Setup**

- Clone repo, install dependencies, run linter (`npm run lint`), and run all tests (`npm test`).
- Review README and project structure.
- Identify and list all warnings, errors, and failing tests.
- Set up a local error monitoring tool (e.g., Sentry, LogRocket) for runtime error capture.

### **Day 2: React Anti-Patterns & State Management**

- Search for direct state mutations and non-functional updates in all hooks and reducers.
- Refactor to use functional updates and immutability helpers.
- Review context usage for unnecessary re-renders or prop drilling.
- Add or update tests for state transitions and context logic.

### **Day 3: Performance Optimization**

- Profile app with React DevTools and Chrome Performance tab.
- Identify slow renders, expensive computations, and unnecessary re-renders.
- Memoize expensive callbacks and derived data with `useMemo`/`useCallback`.
- Optimize filtering, mapping, and sorting logic (e.g., use Sets for lookups).
- Add performance monitoring logs for key actions (e.g., filtering, API calls).

### **Day 4: Error Handling & Edge Cases**

- Audit all async functions for missing try-catch blocks.
- Add comprehensive error handling and user-friendly error messages.
- Implement retry logic for transient network errors.
- Add error state to context/providers for global error display.
- Write tests for error scenarios and edge cases.

### **Day 5: Security Review & Hardening**

- Ensure all API calls use HTTPS.
- Check for exposure of sensitive data in errors/logs.
- Run `npm audit` and update vulnerable dependencies.
- Review for XSS, CSRF, and injection risks (especially if adding user input).
- Add security-related headers and CSP if deploying.

### **Day 6: Code Quality & Maintainability**

- Remove unused code, imports, and variables.
- Refactor unclear or duplicated logic.
- Add comments and improve function/variable naming.
- Ensure consistent formatting (run Prettier or similar tool).
- Add or update documentation (README, code comments, architecture diagrams).

### **Day 7: Testing, Monitoring, & Prevention**

- Write or update unit, integration, and E2E tests for all critical paths.
- Run all tests and ensure 100% pass rate.
- Review error and performance logs for any missed issues.
- Set up CI/CD checks for lint, test, and audit on every PR.
- Document lessons learned and create a checklist for future debugging and code reviews.

## Systematic Debugging & Testing Strategy

- **For Each Bug Category:**
  - Identify root cause via code search, logs, and tests.
  - Write a failing test (if possible) before fixing.
  - Apply the fix, then re-run tests and profiling tools.
  - Monitor for regressions and document the fix.
- **Testing:**
  - Use Jest/React Testing Library for unit/integration tests.
  - Use Cypress or Playwright for E2E flows.
  - Add tests for all edge cases and error scenarios.
- **Monitoring & Prevention:**
  - Use error monitoring (Sentry, LogRocket) in production.
  - Set up automated dependency and security checks.
  - Enforce code reviews and CI checks for all merges.

| Category         | Priority | Example Impact                      |
| ---------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------- |
| State Management | Critical | Broken cart, lost data              |
| Performance      | High     | Slow UI, laggy filtering            |
| Error Handling   | Critical | App crashes, silent failures        |
| Security         | Critical | Data leaks, vulnerable dependencies |
| Code Quality     | Medium   | Hard to debug, maintain, or onboard |
