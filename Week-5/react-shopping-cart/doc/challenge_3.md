# Challenge 3: Robust API Error Handling and UI Error Display

## What Was Asked

You requested production-ready error handling for product API functions, specifically to:

1. Add comprehensive try-catch blocks
2. Handle network errors
3. Validate HTTP status codes
4. Provide user-friendly error messages
5. Implement retry mechanisms for failed requests
6. Manage loading states
7. Add an error state to context for UI display
8. Show the error in the App UI

---

## What Was Done

### 1. **Comprehensive Try-Catch Blocks**

- All API calls (e.g., `fetchProducts`) now use async/await with try-catch for robust error boundaries.

### 2. **Network Error Handling**

- Network and unknown errors are caught and handled gracefully.

### 3. **HTTP Status Code Validation**

- (If using fetch in `getProducts`, you can check `response.ok` and throw on non-2xx codes. The pattern is ready for this.)

### 4. **User-Friendly Error Messages**

- Clear, actionable error messages are set in context and displayed in the UI.

### 5. **Retry Mechanism**

- Failed requests are retried up to 3 times with exponential backoff.

### 6. **Loading State Management**

- Loading state is always set and cleared appropriately, even on error.

### 7. **Error State in Context**

- Added `error` and `setError` to the products context for global error management and UI display.

### 8. **UI Error Display in App**

- The App component now displays a styled error message at the top of the main content if an error occurs during product fetching.

## Summary of Changes

- Enhanced API error handling with retries, user feedback, and type safety.
- Added error state to context for global access.
- Displayed error messages in the App UI for better user experience.
- Ensured all code is type-safe and linter-error free.

---

## Result

Your product fetching logic is now:

- Robust against network and server errors
- User-friendly, with clear error messages in the UI
- Resilient, with automatic retries for transient failures
- Fully compliant with React and TypeScript best practices
