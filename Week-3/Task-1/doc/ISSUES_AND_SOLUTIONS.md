# Issues and Solutions: Header Component Process

## 1. Issue: Incomplete Edge Case Handling

- **Description:** The original Header component did not handle many edge cases (file validation, error handling, accessibility, etc.).
- **Solution:** Identified and documented all edge cases. Updated the component to handle file type/size validation, error states, loading states, and accessibility improvements.

## 2. Issue: TypeScript Error with `includes` Method

- **Description:** TypeScript reported that `includes` does not exist on type `string[]` due to an outdated or misconfigured `lib` setting.
- **Solution:** Replaced `includes` with `indexOf` for compatibility. Also updated the TypeScript config to include modern ECMAScript libraries.

## 3. Issue: Test Coverage Gaps

- **Description:** The existing tests did not cover all edge cases, especially error and accessibility scenarios.
- **Solution:** Expanded the test suite to cover all edge cases, including file validation, error handling, loading state, theme persistence, and keyboard navigation.

## 4. Issue: Theme Persistence and System Preference

- **Description:** Theme preference was not persisted or synced with system changes.
- **Solution:** Implemented localStorage persistence and system theme detection using media queries.

## 5. Issue: Accessibility Gaps

- **Description:** The Header component lacked ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation support.
- **Solution:** Added ARIA attributes, keyboard event handlers, and improved focus management for accessibility.

## 6. Issue: Documentation Gaps

- **Description:** No documentation for edge cases or process.
- **Solution:** Created `EDGE_CASES.md` for edge case scenarios and this document for issues and solutions.
