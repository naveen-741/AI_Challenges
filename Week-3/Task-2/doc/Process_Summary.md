# Process Summary: Feature Implementation for 3D Model Viewer

## Overview

This document outlines the process followed to implement a new feature ("Clear All Models" button) in a React/Three.js 3D model viewer project. It covers the main steps, from initial exploration to final UI/UX refinements.

## 1. Initial Exploration & Understanding

- Explored the project structure and key files.
- Read the README and main components (`App.tsx`, `ModelViewer.tsx`, `Sidebar.tsx`, etc.).
- Summarized the architecture, data flow, and main responsibilities of each component.

## 2. Feature Suggestion & Test-Driven Development

- Proposed a minimal feature: a "Clear All Models" button.
- Created comprehensive, intentionally failing Jest test cases for the feature.
- Set up and debugged Jest/TypeScript configuration issues until tests ran and failed as expected.

## 3. Feature Implementation

- Implemented the "Clear All Models" button, initially in the "Scene Controls" section.
- Moved the button to the "Models" section for better UX.
- Updated code and tests until all tests passed, confirming the feature worked.

## 4. UI/UX Refinements

- Improved button layout, padding, and placement based on user feedback.
- Moved the button to the "Models" section header for clarity.
- Enhanced the button with an icon, tooltip, and custom styles (red background, white icon/text, compact size).
- Iteratively refined the UI for optimal appearance and usability.

## 5. Final Touches

- Added final padding and spacing adjustments as requested.
- Ensured all tests passed and the feature was visually polished.

This process demonstrates a test-driven, user-feedback-driven approach to feature development, with iterative improvements and attention to both functionality and user experience.
