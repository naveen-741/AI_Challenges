# Issues and Solutions: Feature Implementation Journey

## 1. Jest/TypeScript Configuration Issues

- **Issue:** Jest tests would not run due to TypeScript and config errors.
- **Solution:** Adjusted `jest.config.ts` and `tsconfig.jest.json` to ensure compatibility. Added necessary Jest and React Testing Library dependencies.

## 2. Test Failures Due to Missing Features

- **Issue:** Initial tests for the "Clear All Models" button failed (as intended for TDD).
- **Solution:** Implemented the feature step-by-step, updating the code until all tests passed.

## 3. UI/UX Layout and Styling Challenges

- **Issue:** Button placement, padding, and appearance did not meet user expectations.
- **Solution:** Iteratively refined the layout using Tailwind CSS, moved the button to the correct section, and adjusted spacing and styling based on feedback.

## 4. Icon/Button Usability

- **Issue:** The delete icon was not visually clear as a button, lacked a tooltip, and was too tall.
- **Solution:** Made the icon a proper button, added a tooltip, reduced height, and combined icon with the word "Clear" for clarity.

## 5. Color and Accessibility

- **Issue:** Button color and contrast were not optimal for visibility and user guidance.
- **Solution:** Set the button background to red, icon/text to white, and ensured padding and sizing were visually balanced.

## 6. Final UI Polish

- **Issue:** User requested more padding for the button.
- **Solution:** Added `py-1` for extra vertical padding, resulting in a compact yet comfortable button.
