# Project Process Documentation

## 1. Initial Codebase Analysis

- Explored the project structure and dependencies.
- Identified it as a React 17 app using class components and a simple counter.

## 2. Feature Addition: Tic Tac Toe

- Designed and implemented a new `TicTacToe` component as a class-based React component.
- Added game logic, UI, and styles for Tic Tac Toe.
- Integrated the new game into the main `App.js` alongside the counter.

## 3. Styling

- Created a dedicated CSS file for the Tic Tac Toe game.
- Updated `App.css` for better layout and visual separation between features.

## 4. Testing Setup

- Added Jest and React Testing Library dependencies compatible with React 17.
- Created comprehensive test files for both the counter and Tic Tac Toe features.
- Added a setup file for custom Jest matchers.

## 5. Test Coverage

- Wrote tests for all main components and features.
- Added smoke tests for entry files (`index.js`, `reportWebVitals.js`).
- Attempted to achieve 100% coverage for all files.

## 6. Troubleshooting and Iteration

- Addressed issues with dynamic imports and Jest mocks.
- Refactored and rewrote tests multiple times to maximize coverage.
- Documented limitations and best practices for future reference.
