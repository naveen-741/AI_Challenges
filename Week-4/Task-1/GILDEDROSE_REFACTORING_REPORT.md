# GildedRose Refactoring Report

## 1. Issues Identified and Solutions Applied

### Complexity Problems

- **Issue:** Deeply nested conditionals and a long `updateQuality` method made the code hard to read and maintain.
- **Solution:** Refactored using the Strategy Pattern, creating a class for each item type, each encapsulating its own update logic.

### Code Smells

- **Issue:** Magic strings for item names, duplicated logic, lack of comments, and a 'God Method' handling all logic.
- **Solution:** Introduced constants for item names and quality limits, added JSDoc comments, and split logic into specialized classes.

### Business Rule Violations

- **Issue:** Business rules were not clearly documented or enforced, and quality validation was missing.
- **Solution:** Added documentation for business rules, implemented input validation, and enforced quality boundaries.

### Refactoring Opportunities

- **Issue:** Difficult to add new item types or change rules due to monolithic structure.
- **Solution:** Used a factory function and class hierarchy, making the code open for extension and closed for modification.

## 3. Before/After Comparison Tables

### Code Organization and Structure

| Aspect        | Before | After                                                        | Impact                                                     |
| ------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Constants     | None   | Added `ITEM_NAMES`, `QUALITY_LIMITS`, `BACKSTAGE_THRESHOLDS` | Eliminates magic numbers/strings, improves maintainability |
| Documentation | None   | Added JSDoc comments for all classes and methods             | Improves code understanding and maintainability            |
| Type Safety   | Basic  | Enhanced with readonly properties, proper return types       | Reduces potential runtime errors                           |
| Validation    | None   | Added input validation in constructor and methods            | Prevents invalid states                                    |

### Code Complexity Improvements

| Issue               | Before           | After                               | Impact                                   |
| ------------------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Nested Conditionals | 5+ levels deep   | Max 2 levels deep                   | Improved readability and maintainability |
| Method Length       | 40+ lines        | Most methods < 10 lines             | Easier to understand and maintain        |
| Responsibility      | All in one class | Split into specialized classes      | Better separation of concerns            |
| Error Handling      | None             | Added validation and error messages | More robust and debuggable               |

### Specific Improvements

1. **Type Safety & Immutability**

```typescript
// Before
name: string;

// After
public readonly name: string;
```

2. **Constants Instead of Magic Strings**

```typescript
// Before
if (item.name === "Aged Brie")

// After
if (item.name === ITEM_NAMES.AGED_BRIE)
```

3. **Input Validation**

```typescript
// Before
// No validation

// After
private validateQuality(quality: number): void {
  if (quality < QUALITY_LIMITS.MIN) {
    throw new Error(`Quality cannot be negative: ${quality}`);
  }
  // ...
}
```

4. **Cleaner Update Logic**

```typescript
// Before
if (this.items[i].sellIn < 0) {
  if (this.items[i].name != "Aged Brie") {
    // ... nested conditions
  }
}

// After
protected updateSellIn(): void {
  if (this.name !== ITEM_NAMES.SULFURAS) {
    this.sellIn--;
  }
}
```

### Best Practices Implementation

1. **Single Responsibility Principle**

   - Each class now handles one type of item
   - Validation logic is separated
   - Update logic is encapsulated

2. **Open/Closed Principle**

   - New item types can be added by extending `UpdatableItem`
   - No modification of existing code needed

3. **Encapsulation**

   - Private methods for internal logic
   - Protected methods for inheritance
   - Readonly properties where appropriate

4. **Error Handling**
   - Proper validation of inputs
   - Descriptive error messages
   - Type checking

### Performance Considerations

| Aspect     | Before | After           | Impact                                    |
| ---------- | ------ | --------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Memory     | Lower  | Slightly higher | Small overhead for better organization    |
| Validation | None   | Added checks    | Minimal performance impact, better safety |
| Iterations | Same   | Same            | No significant change                     |

### Maintainability Improvements

1. **Documentation**

   - Added JSDoc comments
   - Clear class and method purposes
   - Documented business rules

2. **Code Organization**

   - Constants at the top
   - Logical grouping of related code
   - Clear class hierarchy

3. **Error Prevention**
   - Type safety
   - Input validation
   - Immutable properties where appropriate
